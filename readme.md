# Secure Checkout System

This project is a simple **frontend-based Secure Checkout system** that demonstrates how online card payments can be validated in a user-friendly interface.  
It is intended for **educational and demonstration purposes only** and does not process real transactions.

---

## Project Overview
The system provides a checkout form where users can enter their card details and simulate a payment.  
The form includes **basic validations** such as card number format check (using Luhn’s Algorithm), expiry date, and CVV validation.  

At present, the project is configured to work with **Visa test cards only**.

---

## Features
- Clean and responsive checkout form
- Fields for:
  - Cardholder Name  
  - Card Number (Visa only)  
  - Expiry Date  
  - CVV  
- **Luhn Algorithm implementation** for Visa card number validation  
- Error messages for invalid or incomplete inputs  
- “Secure Checkout – Powered by fictional Visa” label for professional appearance

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structure of the checkout page  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout

## Future Scope

- Integration with backend APIs for real transaction processing  
- Enhanced security features such as tokenization and OTP verification  
- Modern UI improvements with frameworks (React / Vue)
